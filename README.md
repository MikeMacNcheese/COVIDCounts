# COVIDCounts

Hi! Attached is a view of daily COVID-19 vaccine administrations in Canada by province and territory.

The supply schedule is based on the latest information shared on Canada.ca (until May 30). All other data points have been provided by COVID19Tracker.ca, which has been incredibly helpful!

I'm sharing a visualization of this content on Tableau (and sometimes Twitter); feel free to suggest any changes! :)

The forecast for weekly administrations assumes the % of weekly vaccinations/weekly supply maintains.
