# COVIDCounts

Hi! Attached is a view of daily COVID-19 vaccine administrations in Canada by province and territory.

The supply schedule is based on the latest information shared on Canada.ca (until May 16). All other data points have been provided by COVID19Tracker.ca, which has been incredibly helpful!

I'm sharing a visualization of this content on Tableau (and sometimes Twitter); feel free to suggest any changes! :)

The forecast for daily administrations assumes a 35% weekly lift until April 4th for all regions other than Ontario, Quebec, BC, and Alberta. For Ontario, the average day-to-day flow is used for the current week, a consistent volume lift for next week, then 35% for the following. Quebec, BC, and Alberta maintain similar volume lifts to their respective regions and then reverts to 35% for the first week of April. With supply and distribution ramping-up, administrations should do so as well.
