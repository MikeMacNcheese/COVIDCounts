# COVIDCounts

Hi! Attached is a view of daily COVID-19 vaccine administrations in Canada by province and territory.

The supply schedule is based on the latest information shared on Canada.ca (until mid-May). All other data points have been provided by COVID19Tracker.ca, which has been incredibly helpful!

I'm sharing a visualization of this content on Tableau (and sometimes Twitter); feel free to suggest any changes! :)

The forecast of daily administrations is very much a work-in-progress. For Ontario, the next week or so utilizes a day-to-day % shift approach but especially come April we should see supply ramp-up, which will require an adjustment to the methodology. For now, I keep it fairly flat from April onwards. All other regions aside from Ontario currently have the previous weeks volumes loaded as a placeholder (again, there should be some growth considered).
