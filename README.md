# COVIDCounts

Hi! Attached is a view of daily COVID-19 vaccine administrations in Canada by province and territory.

The supply schedule is based on the latest information shared on Canada.ca (until May 18). All other data points have been provided by COVID19Tracker.ca, which has been incredibly helpful!

I'm sharing a visualization of this content on Tableau (and sometimes Twitter); feel free to suggest any changes! :)

The forecast of daily administrations is very much a work-in-progress. As a placeholder, all provinces/territories assume a 40% week-over-week lift until March 28th and then holds flat to the previous week. With supply and distribution ramp-up, administrations should do so as well (admittedly conservative forecast).
