# COVIDCounts

Hi! Attached is a view of weekly COVID-19 vaccine administrations in Canada by province and territory.

The supply schedule is based on the latest information shared on Canada.ca (until May 30). 

Results have been provided by COVID19Tracker.ca, which has been incredibly helpful! 

The forecast for weekly administrations assumes the % of weekly vaccinations/weekly supply maintains.

I'm sharing a visualization of this content on Tableau and Twitter (same username for both); feel free to suggest any changes! :)
